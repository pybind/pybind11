Make sure you've completed the following steps before submitting your issue -- thank you!

1. Make sure you've read the [documentation](http://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Your issue may be addressed there.
2. Consider asking first in the [Gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/pybind/Lobby).
3. Include a self-contained and minimal piece of code that reproduces the problem. If that's not possible, try to make the description as clear as possible.

*After reading, remove this checklist and the template text in parentheses below.*

## Issue description

(Provide a short description, state the expected behavior and what actually happens.)

## Reproducible example code

(The code should be minimal, have no external dependencies, isolate the function(s) that cause breakage. Submit matched and complete C++ and Python snippets that can be easily compiled and run to diagnose the issue.)
