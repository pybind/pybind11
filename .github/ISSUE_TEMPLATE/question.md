If you have a question, please check the following first:

1. Check if your question has already been answered in the [FAQ](http://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html) section.
2. Make sure you've read the [documentation](http://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Your issue may be addressed there.
3. If those resources didn't help and you only have a short question (not a bug report), consider asking in the [Gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/pybind/Lobby).
4. If you have a more complex question which is not answered in the previous items (or not suitable for chat), please fill in the details below.
5. Include a self-contained and minimal piece of code that illustrates your question. If that's not possible, try to make the description as clear as possible.

*After reading, remove this checklist.*
