        Please do your best to make the issue as easy to act on as possible, and only submit here if there is clearly a problem with pybind11 (ask first if unsure). **Note that a reproducer in a PR is much more likely to get immediate attention.**

        Provide a short description, state the expected behavior and what
        actually happens. Include relevant information like what version of
        pybind11 you are using, what system you are on, and any useful commands

      placeholder: >-
        The code should be minimal, have no external dependencies, isolate the
        function(s) that cause breakage. Submit matched and complete C++ and
        Python snippets that can be easily compiled and run to diagnose the
        issue. â€” Note that a reproducer in a PR is much more likely to get
        immediate attention: failing tests in the pybind11 CI are the best
        starting point for working out fixes.
