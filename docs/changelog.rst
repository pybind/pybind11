Changelog
#########

1.2 (not yet released)
--------------------------
* Optional: efficient generation of function signatures at compile time using C++14
* Switched to a simpler and more general way of dealing with function default arguments
  Unused keyword arguments in function calls are now detected and cause errors as expected
* New ``keep_alive`` call policy analogous to Boost.Python's ``with_custodian_and_ward``
* Improved interface for RAII type wrappers in ``pytypes.h``
* Use RAII type wrappers consistently within pybind11 itself. This
  fixes various potential refcount leaks when exceptions occur
* Added new ``bytes`` RAII type wrapper (maps to ``string`` in Python 2.7).
* Made handle and related RAII classes const correct
* Got rid of the ugly ``__pybind11__`` attributes on the Python side---they are
  now stored in a C++ hash table that is not visible in Python
* Fixed refcount leaks involving NumPy arrays and bound functions
* Vastly improved handling of shared/smart pointers
* Removed an unnecessary copy operation in ``pybind11::vectorize``
* Fixed naming clashes when both pybind11 and NumPy headers are included
* Added conversions for additional exception types
* Documentation improvements (using multiple extension modules, smart pointers, other minor clarifications)
* Fixed license text (was: ZLIB, should have been: 3-clause BSD)
* Python 3.2 compatibility

1.1 (December 7, 2015)
--------------------------

* Documentation improvements (GIL, wrapping functions, casting, fixed many typos)
* Generalized conversion of integer types
* Improved support for casting function objects
* Improved support for ``std::shared_ptr<>`` conversions
* Initial support for ``std::set<>`` conversions
* Fixed type resolution issue for types defined in a separate plugin module
* Cmake build system improvements
* Factored out generic functionality to non-templated code (smaller code size)
* Added a code size / compile time benchmark vs Boost.Python
* Added an appveyor CI script

1.0 (October 15, 2015)
------------------------
* Initial release
