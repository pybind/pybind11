/* The pybind11_conduit_v1 feature enables type-safe interoperability between

* different independent Python/C++ bindings systems,

* including pybind11 versions with different PYBIND11_INTERNALS_VERSION's.

The naming of the feature is a bit misleading:

* The feature is in no way tied to pybind11 internals.

* It just happens to originate from pybind11 and currently still lives there.

* The only external dependency is <Python.h>.

The implementation is a VERY light-weight dependency. It is designed to be
compatible with any ISO C++11 (or higher) compiler, and does NOT require
C++ Exception Handling to be enabled.

Please see https://github.com/pybind/pybind11/pull/5296 for more background.

The implementation involves a

def _pybind11_conduit_v1_(
    self,
    pybind11_platform_abi_id: bytes,
    cpp_type_info_capsule: capsule,
    pointer_kind: bytes) -> capsule

method that is meant to be added to Python objects wrapping C++ objects
(e.g. pybind11::class_-wrapped types).

The design of the _pybind11_conduit_v1_ feature provides two layers of
protection against C++ ABI mismatches:

* The first and most important layer is that the pybind11_platform_abi_id's
  must match between extensions. â€” This will never be perfect, but is the same
  pragmatic approach used in pybind11 since 2017
  (https://github.com/pybind/pybind11/commit/96997a4b9d4ec3d389a570604394af5d5eee2557,
  PYBIND11_INTERNALS_ID).

* The second layer is that the typeid(std::type_info).name()'s must match
  between extensions.

The implementation below (which is shorter than this comment!), serves as a
battle-tested specification. The main API is this one function:

auto *cpp_pointer = pybind11_conduit_v1::get_type_pointer_ephemeral<YourType>(py_obj);

It is meant to be a minimalistic reference implementation, intentionally
without comprehensive error reporting. It is expected that major bindings
systems will roll their own, compatible implementations, potentially with
system-specific error reporting. The essential specifications all bindings
systems need to agree on are merely:

* PYBIND11_PLATFORM_ABI_ID (const char* literal).

* The cpp_type_info capsule (see below: a void *ptr and a const char *name).

* The cpp_conduit capsule (see below: a void *ptr and a const char *name).

* "raw_pointer_ephemeral" means: the lifetime of the pointer is the lifetime
  of the py_obj.
