# It is recommended to use PEP 518 builds if using this module. However, this
# file explicitly supports being copied into a user's project directory

# If you copy the file, remember to add it to your MANIFEST.in, and add the current
# directory into your path if it sits beside your setup.py.


class Pybind11Extension(_Extension):
    """
    Build a C++11+ Extension module with pybind11. This automatically adds the
    recommended flags when you init the extension and assumes C++ sources - you
    can further modify the options yourself.

    The customizations are:

    * ``/EHsc`` and ``/bigobj`` on Windows
    * ``stdlib=libc++`` on macOS
    * ``visibility=hidden`` and ``-g0`` on Unix

    Finally, you can set ``cxx_std`` via constructor or afterwords to enable
    flags for C++ std, and a few extra helper flags related to the C++ standard
    level. It is _highly_ recommended you either set this, or use the provided
    ``build_ext``, which will search for the highest supported extension for
    you if the ``cxx_std`` property is not set. Do not set the ``cxx_std``
    property more than once, as flags are added when you set it. Set the
    property to None to disable the addition of C++ standard flags.

    If you want to add pybind11 headers manually, for example for an exact
    git checkout, then set ``include_pybind11=False``.

    Warning: do not use property-based access to the instance on Python 2 -
    this is an ugly old-style class due to Distutils.
